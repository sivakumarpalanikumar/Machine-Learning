# Machine-Learning
    In this repository I have attached the screenshots of machine learning concepts I explored.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    # //Steps in Python program to implement linear models to approximate the given data which I have shared output in the repository

//1. Import the necessary libraries

//2. Load the dataset

//3.Extract dependent and independent variable from the dataset

//4. Construct training and test dataset

//5. Fit the simple linear regression to training set

//6. Predict the test set result

//7. Visualize the training set result

//8. Visualize the test set result
